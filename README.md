## Inspiration
Many college students do not have are unbanked and/or do not have a savings account for many reasons- they think they're too young, the terms and information are hard to understand, or numerous myths. In general, people tend to have little to nothing in savings. With this in mind, we aim to inspire students and people and encourage them to deposit money into savings weekly/monthly.

## What it does
Our application is built with the hopes of incentivizing our users to consistently deposit money into their savings. The user is able to choose and transfer money from their checkings accounts to their savings, and watch their progress toward reaching a goal for their savings accounts. We took inspiration from both two online applications to motivate people, especially college students, to develop healthy savings habits and reach their goal through (1) maintaining and the satisfaction of keeping streaks, (2) growing a digital tree, and (3) eventually planting a seed for a tree in real life once the digital tree is finished growing

## How I built it
We utilized React in making our application a web application, and the GreenSock Animation Platform for animations. We also used NodeJS and Amazon Web Services DynamoDB for our database.

## Challenges I ran into
The (Capital One) Nessie API would occasionally cancel our API requests

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We built an end to end app and we made it to the end!

## What I learned
We learned how NodeJS works, AWS DynamoDB in Javascript (instead of Java), React.js, and GreenSock Animation Platform to allow our tree to animate and grow!

## What's next for Green Queen
There's lots more to be built out! We've only been able to capture the proof of concept, but we hope to be more flexible and give more options to the user for setting savings goals, includig giving suggesstions for how much the user should set a goal for savings based on their income and other factors. In addition, we hope to implement a social aspect of the application in the future, to see how long the streaks are and how large their tree and forest are for a user's friends.
